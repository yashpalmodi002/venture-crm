# Welcome to Laravel CRM!

Thanks for considering the Laravel CRM package for your Laravel business, clients and projects. 

## What is Laravel CRM?

Laravel CRM is a free open-source [Laravel crm package](https://laravelcrm.com) which brings the functionality of expensive platforms such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Pipedrive and many other CRM platforms to Laravel.

## Tech Stack

Laravel CRM is a Laravel package `venturedrake/laravel-crm` that can be installed into any Laravel project with the `composer require` command. The CRM will require some other packages which will be managed as composer dependencies. Your project will also require a database and mail server.

The included user interface uses typical Laravel front-end technology such as Blade, jQuery and Laravel Livewire. However there is no requirement for you to use the included user interface, you can use your own. 

## What are the future plans?

The company [Venture Drake](https://venturedrake.com) behind the Laravel CRM package will continue developing new functionality, updates and maintenance as it has become a core part of how we run our Laravel development business.
